<What i don't seem to understand is even though I know when she is lying to me something keeps me from just being a fuvcked up person >
   << Hi, my name is not important...>>
   I am going to start off with being called that fucked up monster alhtough I seem to have been made out to be this i some times feel like that is what is happening to me.
   Starting to think that there is no point in living... no like when no one wants or needs me my real drive comes from growing with someone but here lately she is 
   acting how everyone else does. this is not really the place to ask this really because of the nature of the website but if someone see's this if we are all from the ether does it
   matter if we die?
